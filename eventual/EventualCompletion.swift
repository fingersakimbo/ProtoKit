/**
 An EventualCompletion object encapsulates a supplied `Eventual` and a supplied completion block which is waiting to
 receive the result of the `Eventual`. It is intended to make it easy to expose a more trational "trailing completion
 block" API to callers, hiding any underlying `Eventual` objects as an implementation detail.
 
 Trailing completion blocks are an effective API design tool when you're trying to discourage callers from coordinating
 complicated asynchronous flows: the resulting "pyramid of doom" is unpleasant to work with, so the offending coordonation
 logic is (usually) quickly identified as something to be moved to a lower layer.
 
 EventualCompletion conforms to ProgressReporting, so that you may vend the Progress object to your callers.
 
 The progress object is set up with a cancellationHandler, such that, if `progress.cancel()` is called on the main thread,
 the originally-supplied trailing completion block will have been called (passing CocoaError(.userCancelled) as the error)
 by the time `progress.cancel()` has returned.
