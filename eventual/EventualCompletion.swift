/**
 An EventualCompletion object encapsulates a supplied `Eventual` and a supplied completion block which is waiting to
 receive the result of the `Eventual`. It is designed to make it easy to expose a more trational "trailing completion
 block" API to callers, hiding any underlying `Eventual` objects as an implementation detail.
 
 If you wish to expose a cancellation facility to callers, you should vend an `NSProgress` object configured with a
 `cancellationHandler` that cancels the underlying unit of work (which would typically generate an NSUserCancelledError
 for propagation to downstream consumers).
 
 If your preference is to simply not execute the EventualCompletion's completion block on cancellation (similar to the
 behavior of `NSURLConnection.cancel()`), then your `cancellationHandler` block may call the `EventualCompletion`
 `disposeHandler()` prior cancelling any outstanding work. However, you are strongly discouraged from using `disposeHandler()` 
 if your completion block exposes the eventual `Error?` to callers: developers who are familiar with modern system APIs
 (such as NSURLSession) will expect cancellations to be reported as an NSUserCancelledError.
 
 There is no need to directly retain a reference to an `EventualCompletion` once it has been constructed, unless you intend
 to call `disposeHandler()`.
